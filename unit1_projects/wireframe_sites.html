		<p>What problem is SB Nation.com solving? What visual challenges are there?</p>
		<p>The site packages various articles from various sports and tones (serious vs. a .Gif of a fan sleeping in the bleachers with a hot dog on his chest) and presenting it in an attractive and appealing way. SBNation is very ad heavy so the site is challenged by not being too cluttered with advertiser creative around their content.
