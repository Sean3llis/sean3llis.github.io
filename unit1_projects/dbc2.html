			<h3>Why Automate?</h3>
			<p class="bodyfont">Automating actions in Photoshop saves you time and effort as well as creating repeated effects with a unique visual style that a human could never produce with such precision and efficacy.</p>
			<ul class="bodyfont">
				<li>Step 1: Begin with an object isolated on a layer that you would like to perform a repeated task on.</li>
				<li>Step 2: Navigate to the "window" tab of your Photoshop nav bar and make sure the actions panel is active or search for it in the Help window.</li>
				<li>Step 3: On the bottom right corner of the Actions panel click the Create New Action button and name it whatever you would like, then hit OK.</li>
				<li>Step 4: You now have your action selected, so decide what action you would like to perform and hit the RECORD button (red circle).</li>
				<li>Step 5: Photoshop is now recording (almost) everything you do. A good action to record would be to duplicate your object (command +j), select that layer, then transform (command +t) your object and set the heigth/width characteristics to 90% of original and rotate by 12 degrees.</li>
				<li>Step 6: Hit the stop recording button.</li>
				<li>Step 7: Now try pressing the PLAY button to run your action on various layers. If you followed the steps above your object should spiral into itself.</li>
