      <h3>Our Views on Responsive Design</h3>
      <h4>By: Dustin Snyder + Sean Ellis</h4>
      <div class="responsive-design"><h4>Responsive Design</h4>
        <p>Responsive design consists of 3 separate but inter-related principles which include:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Fluid Grid</li>
              <li>Responsive Images</li>
              <li>Media Queries</li>
          </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="fluid-layouts"><h4>Fluid Layouts</h4>
        <p>Fluid layout is a design that is oriented in percentages instead
            hard pixels sizes which allows designs to scale with the browser.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="your-conclusion"><h4>Your Conclusion</h4>
        <p>This discipline was created in order to address the changing ecosystem 
          of the web in which the number of devices and the format of those devices has changed exponentially. 
          Browsers now need to adapt from small mobile browsers up to high definition wide screen devices.

      <div class="reflection"><h4>Reflection</h4>
        Add html tags where necessary to make the information make sense. 
        You don't need to keep these questions visible.
        <ul>
          <li>How was it to implement these concepts?</li>
          <li>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</li> 
          <li>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</li> 
          <li>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</li> 
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="references"><h4>References</h4>
        Add list items or delete what you don't need.
        <ul>
          <li><sup>1</sup>Put your reference here (p.s.) What does the sup tag do? Can you use it in your paragraphs to link your info to the references?</li>
          <li><sup>2</sup>reference here</li>
          <li><sup>3</sup>reference here</li>
          <li><sup>4</sup>reference here</li>
          <li><sup>5</sup>reference here</li>
          <li><sup>6</sup>reference here</li>
          <li><sup>7</sup>reference here</li>
