        <h1>Week 7 // Culture</h1>
        <h3>On values and advice.</h3>
        <p>Commitment was the first word to jump out from the list to me. This is because I have developed a notorious talent for starting ambitious projects that I constantly fail to complete. I need to commit to finishing what I start and not biting off more than I chew. Even exercising a small task all the way to it's natural end develops good habits in order to improve my overall ability. The last thing that somebody asked me for advice on was whether or not to move to a new city. Growing up in Texas, a lot of people assume that I have inherently absorbed extremely conservative values despite the fact that I grew up in a very liberal city, Austin. I think this gives me the ability to recognize when someone else is suffering Stereotype Threat and help intervene. Whenever I'm feeling down at DBC (which is inevitable) I need to focus on the fact that everyone will struggle. I know I will want to come in and ace everything off the bat and hold myself to the highest standard possible, but everyone struggles at some point and I will need to learn to give myself slack when a concept or something challenging doesn't come to me immediately. </p>

        <h1>Week 6 // Culture</h1>
        <h3>on the Stereotype Threat</h3>
        <p>I can't say that I've experienced much of this effect personally but it is definitely an important topic, specifically within the tech community. A lack of diversity can have severe negative consequences on a company and on an industry as a whole. What I found particularly interesting in the resources listed for this topic was the phenomenon of "fun vs. intelligence". When students were told that a test explicitly measures intelligence, black students gave themselves a self-conscious handicap and worried as much about not confirming negative stereotypes as they did the test. On the other hand, when all students were told that the test was merely a puzzle and not a good indicator of intelligence the black students performed as well or better than white students. That is a pretty astounding difference with just a small tweak to a variable. If I ever feel like I see this is happening the best course of action would be to eliminate the feeling in the person that they are being judged and viewed on any other level than their performance as a developer - not racial, gender, or otherwise.</p>

        <h3>Ruby Class Methods</h3>
        <p>In ruby, methods after the 'class' keyword are generally instance methods. You can however add methods that are specifically known by the class itself. This is done by defining the method as part of self. Ex: def self.class_method. <a href="http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2009/05/11/class-and-instance-methods-in-ruby/">Learn more</a></p>

        <h1>Week 5 // Culture</h1>
        <h3>subtitle goes here</h3>
        <p>It's interesting reading feedback from challenges in which I felt my pair and I struggled. Most people (including the feedback I've reviewed) seem hesitant to really openly give criticism. I understand why people would be hesitant, but without honest feedback it's difficult to improve. Honestly, I was surprised at my positive feedback on a few GPS challenges where I felt like I should have understood the material much better. Regardless of the positive feedback, I used those wake-up calls as motivation to pick up the pace.</p>
