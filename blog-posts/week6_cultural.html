                    I can't say that I've experienced much of this effect personally but it is definitely an important topic, specifically within the tech community. A lack of diversity can have severe negative consequences on a company and on an industry as a whole. What I found particularly interesting in the resources listed for this topic was the phenomenon of "fun vs. intelligence". When students were told that a test explicitly measures intelligence, black students gave themselves a self-conscious handicap and worried as much about not confirming negative stereotypes as they did the test. On the other hand, when all students were told that the test was merely a puzzle and not a good indicator of intelligence the black students performed as well or better than white students. That is a pretty astounding difference with just a small tweak to a variable. If I ever feel like I see this is happening the best course of action would be to eliminate the feeling in the person that they are being judged and viewed on any other level than their performance as a developer - not racial, gender, or otherwise.
