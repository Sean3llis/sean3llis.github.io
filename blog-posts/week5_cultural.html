                    Honestly, skyping was not something I had really done before DBC and I was strangely nerovus for this aspect of the bootcamp.
                    10 or so pairing in, I am much more comfortable and I completely understand why DBC has written this into Phase 0. While I obviously 
                    benefitted technically from working with someone and seeing different approaches to coding challenges, I think the real benefit from
                    pairing has been the experience of being nervous about something, doing it, and overcoming the discomfort. Phase 1 will be a complete
                    change and some preparation will be merciful for that sudden comfort-zone-yanked-out-from-under-you moment.

                <p class="content">
                    Feedback is pretty much what I expected. Some feedback is reasonably helpful, while other feedback is just very kind commentary on what 
                    I did well. This is usually the case in feedback situations in my experiences. It is difficult to be sincerely critical while actionable and kind
                    and I will definitely continue to need to continue improving on this. Holding something back not only hurts the purpose of the feedback but also 
                    limits and possible deprives the person from a lesson they could need to learn. In the majority of my pairings there was nothing that seriously
                    went wrong, so it's always easy to be the coach at a press conference when your team won. I look forward to that first session where honest feedback
                    is an absolute necessity rather than a comment on a few minor things that could be improved upon.
