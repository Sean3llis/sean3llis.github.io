                    Commitment was the first word to jump out from the list to me. This is because I have developed a notorious talent for starting ambitious projects that I constantly fail to complete. I need to commit to finishing what I start and not biting off more than I chew. Even exercising a small task all the way to it's natural end develops good habits in order to improve my overall ability. The last thing that somebody asked me for advice on was whether or not to move to a new city. Growing up in Texas, a lot of people assume that I have inherently absorbed extremely conservative values despite the fact that I grew up in a very liberal city, Austin. I think this gives me the ability to recognize when someone else is suffering Stereotype Threat and help intervene. Whenever I'm feeling down at DBC (which is inevitable) I need to focus on the fact that everyone will struggle. I know I will want to come in and ace everything off the bat and hold myself to the highest standard possible, but everyone struggles at some point and I will need to learn to give myself slack when a concept or something challenging doesn't come to me immediately.
