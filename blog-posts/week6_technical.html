                    Ruby supports several different type of variables and knowing when to use each is a critical skill. A regular, old variable like fav_color = green is just that, a regular variable with no special strings attached. We can access it once it is created and change it from anywhere. Sometimes, however there is a necessity to prevent a variable from being created from scratch and entered manually. Sometimes you would want every single instance of a class to have a variable, unique to that instance but different from fellow instances. This is called an @instance_variable and it begins with an @-sign. Let's say you wanted a variable on the class-level to count how many instances of that class had been created thus far. That would be a good time to implement a @@class_variable, which is singular only to that class. All instances know about this variable, but there is only one for that entire class and it's value remains constant from instance to instance.
