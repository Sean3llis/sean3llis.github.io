                <p class="content">A very useful method in Ruby, the map method helps to move information from various 
                    ruby collection objects to an array. This is typically done either with .map or .map! depending on
                    how the programmer wants Ruby to handle the existing array. .map! cycles through each element of the
                    container and, like .each, passes a block of code to use on each element as specified by the programmer.
                    In this scenario, if you would like to 'save-as' to a new Array, .map would be your best bet, and an already
                    existing, empty array would work best. This does not affect the contents of the container on which you
                    call .map. However, if you would like to permanently modify the contents of the array and output the results
                    on the container on which you called the method, .map! is your go to.
