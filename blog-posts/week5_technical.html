                    The implementation of classes in Ruby is a powerful organizational tool, which can imbue objects with their own powers via methods,
                    or even their own variables. They can either share their variables with other instances of their class (class variables), or they can have variables
                    specific to their own version of existence within their class. If we had a class, Birds, that accepts a "Beak" initialization parameter
                    and initiated two Bird.new instances, we could say that the Bird class has a @@class variable of @@number_of_legs that all birds share at "2". The two
                    instances of bird we just initiated could def initialize(beak) with "long and pointy" and "flat and bill-like". setting @beak_type equal to these
                    two strings would create a variable unique that that bird (ex: woodpecker and daffy duck).
