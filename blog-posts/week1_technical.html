				<a href="http://www.designspiration.com"><h3>Designspiration</h3></a>
				<p>I like this site because of how it presents a large variety of images and media in an easily digestable way that is still aesthetically pleasing. The search functionality is minimalistic and simple and you even have the option of searching by color. </p>

				<a href="http://www.sbnation.com" target="_blank"><h3>SB Nation</h3></a>
				<p>SB Nation formats their pages so that the articles are image-focused and constantly updated with up-to-date information from other news sources beyond their own. The comment functionality is fantastic for discussing hotly debated articles and even top comments are highlighted based on popularity. </p>

				<h3>Week 2 Post - Class vs. ID in CSS</h3>
				<p>HTML elements can be modified via CSS attributes on their own, but sometimes you need to be a little more specific. In many cases, both a "class" element and an "ID" element would get the job done, but certain situations call for one over the other. A good analogy I've <a href="#">found on the web</a> for thinking about classes versus ID's is to imagine an iPod at Best Buy. All the iPods of similar <strong>type, color and size</strong> will have the same barcode. This tells the store that it is a specific "class" of iPod. However, if you wanted to refer that ONLY that iPod you would need its <strong>serial number</strong>. This is like an ID - a unique modifier that refers to only a specific element. If you want to change a number of elements at once, use a class.
