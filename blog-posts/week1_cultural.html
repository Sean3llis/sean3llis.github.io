				<h3>My Thoughts on Dev Bootcamp</h3></a>
				<p>My first thoughts after watching Shereef's fireside chat were similar to the feeling I got when I read through the FAQ section before applying. DBC is great at providing honest, merciful and upfront discussions on what happens to people who are not cut out for this. It's still too early to tell if I will count myself among the people who get cut or forced to repeat, but my reaction is not one of fear but rather one of gratitude. This honesty at the beginning puts everyone on notice and gives everyone a "no-bs" look into what the rules of the game. I could not be more excited to be a part of the culture at Dev Bootcamp because I've always been the type of person to immerse myself in something in order to learn. In the past I had just locked myself in my room until I learned something like Photoshop. Now I will be able to interact and learn from people who actually know what they're talking about as opposed to scouring the free tutorial sites of the web. I'm nervous. But I decided when I got in I would "buy in" to the system and give my all and trust in the program to take me the rest of the way.
