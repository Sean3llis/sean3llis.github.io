                <h2 class="postname">The filetype issue</h2>
                <p class="content">I think a major issue facing the tech industry is the public's adoption rate of
                    new technologies. People are so trained to use what is comfortable to them that even an update
                    that brings functionality, style, load times, etc. is met with "WE HATE CHANGE" reactions.
                    Some people hold their online identity very closely and it's understandable that once certain
                    people develop an online comfort zone, that digital threats to that status quo are met with
                    passionate objection (whether those threats are an improvement or not.) The best example of this
                    is Facebook. Everytime facebook has tweaked its layout slightly, large amounts of my friends would 
                    moan and complain about how facebook is awful, how they're going to delete it, how they're so dumb
                    for not listening to their userbase, etc. 
                    <br>
                    Well, SHOULD you listen to your userbase if you know they
                    will just end up adapting eventually to the newer, better layout? Or should you neglectfully let them
                    wallow in rapidly outdating formats that they are more familiar with? It is frustrating to see
                    people who are so afraid of change when it is almost always for the better.
