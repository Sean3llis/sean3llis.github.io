                <h2 class="postname">Learning Style - Week 3</h2>
                <p class="content">My learning style benefits the most from first watching someone perform a task first then actually repeating the task myself. In terms of media, I'm a 'slight visual learner' but I feel comfortable digesting written and auditory information as well. Ideally, a YouTube tutorial video that is well-made and produced is the best situation. My biggest struggle so far with Dev Bootcamp has been with missing small details in the instruction that end up frustrating me down the line. I incorrectly set up my Github account and folders and paid the price in Week 1 when nothing would update and I was very confused and helpless. Once I took a deep breath and started over from step 1, I identified the issue and moved on, but in the future I must pay specific attention to reading the instructions all the way through. I think this issue stems from a desire to get to work on a challenge and not focus too much on the upfront explanation. I like to learn as I go and following step-by-step extremely detailed instructions tests my patience and that is a key area I need to improve on. I've started forcing myself to re-read the instructions twice. Once before attempting the releases, and then again after briefly skimming each of the challenges for a preview of tasks I'll need to complete and if any information in the summary jumps out at me.

                Some ways I can expand my thinking style would be to stop avoiding challenges. I noted a blog post I had early last week that warned of people who are raised to believe they are 'special' and a 'natural' at everything and the adverse effect it has on them. These people, the post argued, had a tendency to shy away from challenges that might paint them as a non whiz-kid or Chosen One. I suffer from this a little and must be patient with myself and not be afraid to fail. I will fail often, I'm assuming in Dev Bootcamp, and must learn to focus on what to improve, not what others think of me.
